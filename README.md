#Python Programming

This repository began as practice of the Python programming as I learned the syntax of the language and includes a Tic-Tac-Toe and Blackjack game.

It has since been become the repository that I upload code that I have learned from the MIT Open Courseware lectures for Introduction to Computer Science, since the course utilizes the python language.
